"""Cholester droplet example.

In this example, we use multiple passes and a 4x4 method to compute reflections 
off the cholesteric droplet. For cholesterics one should take the norm = 2 argument in the
computation of the tranfered field and have npass > 1 to compute reflections.

It is best to take odd number of passes, so that one can check the residual field
(the back propagating part) of the output field . With each iteration
the back propagating part of the output field reduces.

In this example we calculate off-axis reflection; the beta parameter is not zero.
The actual beta in the experiment differs because the illumination_data
returns the nearest eigenwave mode.
