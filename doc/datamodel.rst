Data Model
==========

There are two types of data, one describing the optical properties of the sample and the second describing the electro-magnetic field of the in-going and out-going light. We will call the first one an *optical data* and the second one a *field data*. But first, let us define the coordinate system, units and conventions.

.. _conventions:

Coordinate system, units and conventions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Wavelengths are defined in nanometers.
* Dimensions (coordinates) are defined in pixel units. 
* In the computations, size of the pixel is defined as a parameter (in nanometers).
* Optical parameters (orientation of the optical axis) are defined relative to the reference laboratory coordinate frame *xyz*.  
* Propagation is said to be *forward propagation* if the wave vector has a positive *z* component. 
* Propagation is said to be *backward propagation* if the the wave vector has a negative *z* component.
* Light enters the material at *z=0*  at the bottom of the sample and exits at the top of the sample.
* The sample is defined by a sequence of layers - a *stack*. The first layer is the one at the bottom of the stack.
* Internally, optical parameters are stored in memory as a C-contiguous array with axes (i,j,k,...) the axes are *z*, *y*, *x*, *parameter(s)*.

For uniaxial material, the orientation of the optical axis is defined with two angles. :math:`\theta_m` is an angle between the *z* axis and the optical axis  and :math:`\phi_m` is an angle between the projection of the optical axis vector on the *xy* plane and the *x* axis.

For biaxial media, there is an additional parameter :math:`\psi_m` that together with :math:`\theta_m`and :math:`\phi_m` define the three Euler angles for rotations of the  frame around the z,y and z axes respectively.

Direction of light propagation (wave vector) is defined with two parameters, :math:`\beta_x = n \sin\theta_k \cos\phi_k` and  :math:`\beta_y = n \sin\theta_k \sin\phi_k`, or equivalently :math:`\beta = \sqrt{\beta_x^2 + \beta_y^2} = n \sin\theta_k` and :math:`\phi_k = \arctan(\beta_y/\beta_x)`, where :math:`\theta_k` is an angle between the wave vector and the *z* axis, and :math:`\phi_k` between the projection of the wave vector on the *xy* plane and the *x* axis. 

Parameter :math:`\beta` is a fundamental parameter in transfer matrix method. This parameter is conserved when light is propagated through a stack of homogeneous layers.

.. _optical-data:

Optical Data
++++++++++++

Starting with version 0.7.0, the optical data format has changed. In the previous version, optical data, which is now termed an optical block, was a tuple. Instead, optical data is now a list of optical blocks. Optical block can be single or multiple-layer data. The optical data structure is defined below.

Nondispersive model
-------------------

First we will explain the noondispersive model, where material parameters are treated as fixed (independent on wavelength). Let us build an example optical block data:

.. doctest::

   >>> import dtmm
   >>> optical_block = dtmm.nematic_droplet_data((60, 128, 128), 
   ...    radius = 30, profile = "r", no = 1.5, ne = 1.6, nhost = 1.5)

Here we have generated some test optical data, a nematic droplet with a radius of 30 pixels placed in a bounding box of shape (60,128,128), that is, 60 layers of (height - *y*, width - *x*) of (128,128). Director profile is radial, with ordinary refractive index of 1.5 and extraordinary refractive index of 1.6 placed in an isotropic host with refractive index of 1.5. The optical data is a list of one element - a single **optical block**, which is tuple of three arrays

.. doctest::

   >>> thickness, material_eps, eps_angles = optical_block

`thickness` describes the thickness of layers in the optical data. It is an array of floats. It is measured in pixel units. In our case it is an array of ones of length 60:

.. doctest::

   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> np.allclose(thickness, np.ones(shape = (60,)))
   True 

which means that layer thickness is the same as layer pixel size - a cubic lattice. Note that in general, layer thickness may not be constant and you can set any layer thickness. `material_eps` is an array of shape (60,128,128,3) of dtype "float32" or "float64" and describes the three eigenvalues of the dielectric tensor of the material. In our case we have two types of material, a host material (the one surrounding the droplet), and a liquid crystal material. We can plot this data:

.. doctest::

   >>> fig, ax = dtmm.plot_material(material_eps, dtmm.refind2eps([1.5,1.5,1.6]))
   >>> fig.show()

which plots dots at positions where liquid_crystal is defined (where the refractive indices are [1.5,1.5,1.6]). This plots a sphere centered in the center of the bounding box, as shown in Fig.

.. plot:: examples/plot_material.py

   LC is defined in a sphere .



`material_eps` is an array of shape (60,128,128,3). Material is defined by three real (or complex) dielectric tensor eigenvalues (refractive indices squared):

.. doctest::

   >>> material_eps[0,0,0]
   array([2.25, 2.25, 2.25])
   >>> material_eps[30,64,64]
   array([2.25, 2.25, 2.56])
   
The real part of the dielectric constant is the refractive index squared and the imaginary part determines absorption properties. 

`eps_angles` is an array of shape (60,128,128,3) and describe optical axis angles measured in radians in voxel. For isotropic material these are all meaningless and are zero, so outside of the sphere, these are all zero:

.. doctest::

   >>> eps_angles[0,0,0]
   array([0., 0., 0.])

while inside of the sphere, these three elements are

.. doctest::

   >>> eps_angles[30,64,64] #z=30, y = 64, x = 64
   array([0.        , 0.95531662, 0.78539816])

The first element is always 0 because it defines the :math:`\psi_m` angle (used in biaxial materials), the second value describes the :math:`\theta_m` angle, and the last describes the :math:`\phi_m` angle.

We can plot the director around the center (around the point defect) of the droplet by

.. doctest::

   >>> fig, ax = dtmm.plot_angles(eps_angles, center = True, xlim = (-5,5), 
   ...              ylim = (-5,5), zlim = (-5,5))
   >>> fig.show()

.. note::

   matplotlib cannot handle quiver plot of large data sets, so you have to limit dataset visualization to a small number of points. The center argument was used to set the coordinate system origin to bounding box center point and we used xlim, ylim and zlim arguments to slice data.
    
.. plot:: examples/plot_data_angles.py

   LC director of the nematic droplet near the center of the sphere. Director is computed from director angles. There is a point defect in the origin. 



.. Director length in the `eps_angles` data should normally be 1. However, you can set any      value. This value is then used to compute the refractive indices of the material. In fact this value is treated as a nematic order parameter, which is used to compute the refractive indices from the following formula:

   .. math:: 

   \epsilon_1 = \epsilon_{m} - 1/3  S  \epsilon_{a}

   \epsilon_2 = \epsilon_{m} - 1/3  S  \epsilon_{a}

   \epsilon_3 = \epsilon_{m} + 2/3  S  \epsilon_{a}
  

   where :math:`\epsilon_{m}` is the mean value of dielectric tensor elements and :math:`\epsilon_{a} = \epsilon_{3}-\epsilon_{1}` is the anisotropy. 


Dispersive model
----------------

If you want to simulate wavelength dispersion, epsv must no longer be a constant array, but you must define it to be a callable. For each wavelength, the algorithm computes the epsv  array from the provided callable. For instance, to use Cauchy approximation with two coefficients, there is a helper object to create such callable:

   >>> epsc = EpsilonCauchy(shape = (60,128,128), n = 2)
   >>> epsc.coefficients[...,0] = (material_eps)**0.5  # a term, just set to refractive index
   >>> epsc.coefficients[...,0:2,1] = 0.005*(material_eps[...,0:2])**0.5   # b term ordinary
   >>> epsc.coefficients[...,2,1] = 0.005*(material_eps[...,2])**0.5  # b term extraordinary

Now you can compute the epsilon tensor eigenvalues by calling the callable with the wavelength in 
nanometers as an argument, e.g.::

   >>> material_eps = epsc(550)

To use the dispersive material in computations, you must pass the following optical data to the tranfer_field function::

   >>> optical_data = [(thickness, epsc, material_angles)]

Note that you may create your own callable for material_eps, but the callable must return a valid numpy array describing the epsilon tensor eigenvalues that is compatible with material_angles matrix and the thickness array.
 
Multi-block data
----------------

Above, we demonstrated the usage of single-block data. A multi-block data consists of several data blocks. These may be multi-layer blocks, as in the examples above, or single-layer data.  For instance, a uniaxial retarder of a thickness of 1. and with optical axes in the deposition plane and rotated by 45 degrees with respect to the horizontal axis is::

   >>> retarder_data = [(1.,(1.5**2, 1.5**2, 1.6.**2),(0., np.pi/2, np.pi/4))]
   
Above retarder data is a valid optical data. It describes a single block, which itself is a single-layer data. Note that we could have set the block as a multi-layered block with the length of layers equal to 1, e.g.::

   >>> retarder_data = [((1.,),((1.5**2, 1.5**2, 1.6.**2),),((0., np.pi/2, np.pi/4)),)]
   
For 2D blocks (1D grating structure) you can do::

   >>> grating_data = [(1.,((1.5**2, 1.5**2, 1.6.**2),)*128,((0., np.pi/2, np.pi/4),))*128)]  
    
All examples above are actually shorthand for creating 1D or 2D data. Internally, true data format is 3D. You can validate data format (to make it 3D) by calling::

   >>> validated_grating_data = dtmm.data.validate_optical_data(grating_data)
   
This function converts the data to a valid 3D optical data format. For 1D and 2D input data, it adds dimensions to optical blocks. You do not need to validate optical data yourself, as this is done internally when calling the computation functions. Now we have::

   >>> d,epsv,epsa = validated_grating_data[0] #take first (and only) block
   >>> epsv.shape
   (1,1,128,3)
   >>> epsa.shape
   (1,1,128,3)
   
You can add blocks together to form a new stack of data::

    >>> new_optical_data = retarder_data + optical_data + grating_data
    >>> validated_optical_data = dtmm.data.validate_optical_data(new_optical_data, shape = (128,128), wavelength = 500)
    
There are two things to notice here. First, we used the wavelength argument for the validation. This ensures that we evaluate the refractive indices (epsilon values) at a given wavelength because we used dispersive data for one of the blocks. Second, we used the shape argument, which describes the requested cross-section shape of the optical blocks. Because we mix different dimensions of the blocks (1D, 2D, and 3D in our case), we have to provide a common shape for all blocks to which each block is broadcasted. 
   
Function :func:`dtmm.data.validate_optical_data` raises an exception if it cannot produce a valid optical data, if shapes of the blocks do not match. It is up to the user to prepare each data block with a cross-section shapes which can all broadcast together.

Layered data
------------

Finally, there is yet another valid optical data format, labeled layered data. You can build layers data from list of blocks. E.g.::

   >>> layers = dtmm.data.layered_data(validated_optical_data)
   >>> isinstance(layers, list)
   True
   >>> len(layers)
   62

which constructs a list of 62 elements, 2 for the extra two blocks, and 60 for the LC block. Each  element of the layered_data now describes a single layer::

   >>> d, epsv, epsa = layers[0]
   >>> d
   1.
 
.. _field-waves:

Field Data
++++++++++

.. doctest::

   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> pixelsize = 100
   >>> wavelengths = [500,600]
   >>> shape = (128,128)
   >>> field_data = dtmm.illumination_data(shape, wavelengths, 
   ...       pixelsize = pixelsize)

Here we used a :func:`.field.illumination_data` convenience function that builds the field data for us. We will deal with colors later, now let us look at the field_waves data. It is a tuple of two `ndarrays` and a scalar :

.. doctest::

   >>> field, wavelengths, pixelsize = field_data

Now, the `field` array shape in our case is:

.. doctest::

   >>> field.shape
   (2, 2, 4, 128, 128)

which should be understood as follows. The first axis is for the polarization of the field. With the :func:`.field.illumination_data` we have built initial field of the incoming light that was specified with no polarization, therefore, :func:`.field.illumination_data` build waves with *x* and *y* polarizations, respectively, so that it can be used in the field viewer later. The second axis is for the wavelengths of interest, therefore, the length of this axis is 2, as

.. doctest::

   >>> len(wavelengths)
   2

The third axis is for the EM field elements, that is, the *E_x*, *H_y*, *E_y* and *H_x* components of the EM field. The last two axes are for the height, width coordinates (*y*, *x*). 

A multi-ray data can be built by providing the *beta* and *phi* parameters (see the :ref:`conventions` for definitions):

.. doctest::

   >>> field_data = dtmm.illumination_data(shape, wavelengths, 
   ...       pixelsize = pixelsize, beta = (0,0.1,0.2), phi = (0.,0.,np.pi/6)) 
   >>> field, wavelengths, pixelsize = field_data
   >>> field.shape
   (3, 2, 2, 4, 128, 128)  

If a single polarization, but multiple rays are used, the shape is: 

.. doctest::

   >>> field_data = dtmm.illumination_data(shape, wavelengths, jones = (1,0),
   ...       pixelsize = pixelsize, beta = (0,0.1,0.2), phi = (0.,0.,np.pi/6)) 
   >>> field, wavelengths, pixelsize = field_data
   >>> field.shape
   (3, 2, 4, 128, 128)  

How does it look like? Let us apply a circular aperture to the field and plot it. The field is a cross section of a plane wave with wave vector defined by the wavelength, pixel size and direction (beta, phi) as can be seen in the images.  

.. plot:: examples/plot_field.py

   The real part of the Ex component of the EM field for the three directions (beta, phi) and two wavelengths. Top row is for 500nm data, bottom row is 600nm data.

Field vector
++++++++++++

For 1D and 2D simulations with a non-iterative algorithm we use field vector instead. There are conversion functions that you can use to build field data from field vector and vice-versa, e.g:

.. doctest::

   >>> fvec = dtmm.field.field2fvec(field)
   >>> fvec.shape
   (3, 2, 128, 128, 4)
   >>> field = dtmm.field.fvec2field(fvec)
   >>> field.shape
   (3, 2, 4, 128, 128)

Jones field
+++++++++++

For 2x2 methods, the computation is done using jones fields, which is Electric field-only representation of the electro-magnetic field. To complete the transform you need to add
additional info about the material and field. One can convert the field data to jones field by::

   >>> jones = dtmm.field.field2jones(field, beta = 0, phi = 0, epsv = (1,1,1))  
   >>> jones.shape
   (3, 2, 2, 128, 128)
   
Above transform assumes that field has a well-defined wave vector and is propagating in vacuum along z direction. For wide beams of light, the assumption of a well-defined wave vector is valid, but for narrow beams, or for beams with high frequency components, you should instead call the function without the beta and phi terms and provide the wave numbers, e.g.::

   >>> jones = dtmm.field.field2jones(field, dtmm.wave.k0(wavelengths, pixelsize), epsv = (1,1,1))  

The above transform takes the modes of the field and takes the forward propagating part (you can also compute back-propagating part using `mode = -1` argument) of the field, then it takes the Ex and Ey components of the field and stores them into the output array. Note that the resulting jones field is not a true Jones vector (except for beta = 0), because the Electric field components of the jones field are represented in the laboratory coordinate frame. The light intensity is not simply :math:`|jones|^2`. You should convert back to EM field, if you plan to compute anything with jones field.
