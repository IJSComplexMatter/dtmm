Overview
========

``dtmm`` is a free and open-source software package for near-field propagation and visualization of electro-magnetic fields in complex birefringent media. Useful for calculation of:

- Transmittance & reflectance of thin structures, e.g., confined liquid crystals. 
- Polarizing optical microscope simulation. See :ref:`example`.

*DTMM* stands for Diffractive Transfer Matrix Method and is an adapted Berreman 4x4 transfer matrix method and an adapted 2x2 extended Jones method. Details of the method are given in *... some future paper*. See :ref:`method` for a quick explanation of the method.

   If you are into transmission optical microscopy simulations you may want to check `nemaktis`_, which uses ``dtmm`` as one of the back-ends.

Highlights
----------

- Easy-to-use interface.
- Fast and efficient code.
- Support for the nematic director, Q tensor or dielectric tensor input data.
- Computes **transmission and reflection** from the material.
- Computes **interference and diffraction** effects.
- **Biaxial, uniaxial and isotropic** material supported.
- Support for **dispersive material**: Cauchy or Sellmeier data.
- **Fast iterative algorithm** for 3D data - with tunable accuracy.
- Non-iterative algorithm for 2D data - equivalent to the iterative algorithm with max accuracy settings. 
- Exact calculation for homogeneous layers (1D). 
- **EM field visualizer** (polarizing microscope simulator) allows you to simulate:

   - Light source intensity.
   - Polarizer/analyzer orientation and type (LCP, RCP or linear).
   - Phase retarders (lambda/4, lambda/2).
   - Sample rotation.
   - Focal plane adjustments.
   - Koehler illumination (field aperture).
   - Objective aperture.
   - Immersion or standard microscopes.
   - Cover glass aberration effects.

- **Color rendering** (RGB camera simulations based on CIE color matching functions). 
- Pre-defined spectral response for monochrome CMOS cameras. 
   
Status and limitations
----------------------

``dtmm`` was developed mainly for light propagation through liquid crystals, but it can also be used for simple 1D simulations using Jones calculus, or transfer matrix method. See the tutorial section for details. There are still some unresolved issues and limitations.  These limitations are likely to be improved/implemented in the future (**Contributions are welcome**):
 
- Limited color rendering functions and settings - no white balance correction of computed images.
- Regular-spaced mesh only with equal spacing in x and y directions.  

.. note::

   EM field propagation calculation based on the iterative and non-iterative approach for 2D and 3D is exact for homogeneous layers, but it is approximate for inhomogeneous layers. See :ref:`accuracy` for details. 

The package is still evolving, so there may be some small API changes in the future. Other than that, the package is fully operational. Play with the example below to get an impression on how it works.

.. _example:

Example
-------

.. doctest::

   >>> import dtmm
   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> NLAYERS, HEIGHT, WIDTH = (60, 96, 96)
   >>> WAVELENGTHS = np.linspace(380,780,9)

Build a sample optical data; a nematic droplet with a hedgehog defect in the center:

.. doctest::

   >>> optical_block = dtmm.nematic_droplet_data((NLAYERS, HEIGHT, WIDTH), 
   ...     radius = 30, profile = "r", no = 1.5, ne = 1.6, nhost = 1.5)

Build illumination data (input EM field); a multi-wavelength plane wave source:

.. doctest::

   >>> field_data_in = dtmm.illumination_data((HEIGHT, WIDTH), WAVELENGTHS,
   ...       pixelsize = 200) 

Transfer the field through the sample:

.. doctest::

   >>> field_data_out = dtmm.transfer_field(field_data_in, [optical_block])

Visualize the transmitted field with matplotlib plot:

.. doctest::

   >>> viewer = dtmm.pom_viewer(field_data_out)
   >>> viewer.set_parameters(sample = 0, polarizer = "h",
   ...      focus = -18, analyzer = "v")
   >>> fig, ax = viewer.plot() #creates matplotlib figure and axes
   >>> fig.show()


.. plot:: examples/hello_world.py

   Simulated optical polarizing microscope image of a nematic droplet with a radial nematic director profile (a point defect in the middle of the sphere). You can use sliders to change the focal plane, polarizer, sample rotation, analyzer, and light intensity.

Curious enough? Read the :ref:`quickstart`.
